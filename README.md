# C_Code_Optimization
Optimization of a C++ program.

### Description
There are two separate code files in this repository. The one named 'Starter' was __not written by me__ but rather given to me by BYU-Idaho to optimize. The second file 'optimized' is the optimized version of the starter file that I wrote. The starter file's runtime is clocked at around 2,250 ms. After optimization, my version clocks in at 125 ms, which is roughly a speedup of 25x.

I uploaded these files as a way to demonstrate my ability to not only write C++ code but my ability to write efficient code. Thanks for looking!
